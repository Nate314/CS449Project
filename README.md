# Finance App

### Nathan Gawith

# **Vision Statement**

Finance App is inspired by my mother&#39;s small business needs for bookkeeping but could also be used as a personal finance tracker. The app&#39;s main functionality is to allow the user to input expenses and income, view reports over month/year timelines, and reconcile balances between bank accounts and what the user has input into the system. Every transaction will allow the user to associate a date, description, category, and amount so that later reports can be ran based on those amounts, dates, and categories.

When the user opens the application, he/she will be greeted with a login screen which they will type in their username/password into and then move on to the main welcome screen. From the welcome screen the user will be able to perform 5 actions:

1. Accounts - View current account balances and totals
2. Income - Log an income transaction (ex: client payment for a service)
3. Expense - Log an expense transaction (ex: hotel, rental car, travel food, paychecks)
4. Register - View a log of all: open/close account transactions, income/expense transactions
5. Reports - View a concise report 1) over the selected time period, 2) broken out based on accounts or categories

Stretch Goals:

1. Sign in with Google.
2. Add a page specifically for transfers rather than logging a separate expense/income.
3. Filter register based on category, description, etc.
4. Specify specific categories/accounts to include in a report rather than all categories/accounts.
5. Prompt to transfer balance to another account when deleting an account.
6. Subcategories (Travel category could include Gas, Hotel, and Food subcategories)
7. Allow reports to be generated through a website so that they can easily be printed from a desktop or laptop.
8. Scheduled transactions (ex: paycheck for each employee every two weeks)
9. Attach a photo of a receipt to each income/expense transaction
10. Localization (allow for non-English languages throughout the application)
